# How to run Dealer Management Simulation.

Step 1) Ensure you are running Python 3.12 or a verison that is compatible with Python 3 on your system.

Step 2) Download or clone the repositoy with all files. Use a directory you will remember.

Step 3) Using a CMD (Command Prompt/Terminal), ensure you are in the right directory with the files above and launch the app 
by running main.py ''python3 main.py''. This was tested in Linux Ubuntu 24.1 via WSL 2.

Project by Group 3, CMPS 3000 BSA. Fall 2025. 
This program was designed for terminal program users from the 80s-90s who still want to run a 
computationally effiecient program for a real world dealer management problem at an entry level budget.
Their buyers are intended to meet their criteria given the specialized business operation that would like to simulate and run a minimal viable product
until they have the budget to implement upgrades, to which this program caters to an audience who appreciates readability, writability, abstraction, and computationally efficient code.
