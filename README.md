# How to run Dealer Management Simulation.

Step 1) Ensure you are running Python 3.12 or a version  that is compatible with Python 3 on your system.

Step 2) Download or clone the repository with all files. Use a directory you will remember.

Step 3) Using a CMD (Command Prompt/Terminal), ensure you are in the right directory with the files above and launch the app 
by running main.py ''python3 main.py''. This was tested in Linux Ubuntu 24.1 via WSL 2.

This program was designed for terminal program users from the 80s-90s who still want to run a 
computationally efficient program for a real world dealer management problem at an entry level budget.
Their buyers are intended to meet their criteria given the specialized business operation that would like to simulate and run a minimal viable product
until they have the budget to implement upgrades, to which this program caters to an audience who appreciates readability, writability, abstraction, and computationally efficient code.
For maximum security, run this program and do not close it until you are ready to close your business permanently. Otherwise you will loose your data. Additionally, registered buyers may self serve their purchases at the main dealer terminal securely.
